-A Static Website for Bullwhip Catering-

Bullwhip Catering is a company owned by my friend, Cody Weinrich of Casper, WY.

This is a gifted (no charge) updated website for bullwhipcatering.com. Bullwhipcatering.com had not been updated since the 1990s.

The original owner of Bullwhip Catering was Cody's grandfather. 

A great part (about 70%) of the original banner (horse, cowboy, whip and lettering) were preserved as both a tribute to Cody's grandfather, as well as a continuation of brand that the community of Casper has known and loved for many years. If you were to know anything about Casper, WY, you should know that it is one of the best preserved pieces of America's West. By that, I mean that nothing ever really changes around there, and they like it that way. So if you are not a fan of the old school style of brand logo, my apologies. However, the actual audience / traffic of the site will find comfort in it.

Cody did not have many ideas for the site when I offered to develop the site for him. So, in a weeks time I made about ten variations of sites for Cody to look over, and from there he was able to give me feedback about what he liked about each variation. 

Respecting Cody's time was a great priority of mine, as was meeting his personal desires for his sites' website. I went to reddit /webdev and /webdesign to get some feedback on the usability of the site. Some feedback was from fellow but furhter experienced designers, other was from laymen. But, both categories of feedback were equally heeded and incorporated into the site design as it currently is. 

In due time, I plan to incorporate a payment gateway for Cody to sell his Seasoning online. I also plan to make changes that will implement skills I plan to develop. This site is very amateur, as is the code that built it. 

From start to finish, this site was completed in two weeks' time.

This site was developed as my first development project. All Javascrip used was code that I manipulated from templates located online. All HTML and CSS was done from scratch.

This was a great started project for me. I gained new skills (to name one: deploying a site via github) and experience (to name one: the process of desigining as a fullstack for a real client).
